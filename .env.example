# Crawl4AI Adaptive Crawler v3.5.0 Environment Variables
# This is a TEMPLATE file - do NOT put real API keys here!

# Required: DeepSeek API Key for answer generation
# Get your API key from: https://platform.deepseek.com/
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here

# Optional: OpenRouter API Key for re-ranking phase
# Get your API key from: https://openrouter.ai/
# Model used: qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b
#
# RE-RANKING PHASE (optional, improves quality):
#   - After crawling, re-ranks pages by semantic similarity
#   - Uses OpenRouter embeddings for high-quality scoring
#   - Helps surface the most relevant content
#
# Without OpenRouter:
#   - Uses crawl scores only (still works, just less accurate)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here

# Optional: Server port (Zeabur sets this automatically)
PORT=8080

# ============================================================
# NOTE: OPENAI_API_KEY is NOT required!
#
# EMBEDDING STRATEGY (v3.5.0) runs LOCALLY:
#   - Uses sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
#   - No API calls needed for crawling
#   - Semantic link selection works out of the box
